# pomodoro_timer
This is a **Pomodoro Timer desktop application** built using Python's `tkinter` GUI library. It's designed to help users apply the **Pomodoro Technique** — a time management method that alternates focused work sessions with short breaks to boost productivity.


Features

- **Custom Timer Logic**  
  Tracks *Work*, *Short Break*, and *Long Break* intervals using a clean countdown mechanism.

- **Automatic Session Switching**  
  Automatically starts the next timer session after each countdown completes.

- **Visual Progress Indicators**  
  Shows checkmarks (`✓`) for each completed work session.
